# Pareto Frontier Calculation for Accuracy vs Latency

## Overview

The Pareto frontier is a fundamental concept in multi-objective optimization that identifies the set of solutions where you cannot improve one metric without worsening another. In the context of model optimization, it helps identify the optimal trade-offs between accuracy and latency.

## What is a Pareto Frontier?

A Pareto frontier (also called Pareto front or Pareto set) consists of solutions that are **Pareto optimal**. A solution is Pareto optimal if:

- **No other solution dominates it** - meaning no other solution is better in all objectives
- **You cannot improve one objective without worsening another**

### Dominance Definition

Solution A **dominates** Solution B if:
- A is better than B in at least one objective, AND
- A is not worse than B in any other objective

For accuracy vs latency:
- Higher accuracy is better
- Lower latency is better

So Solution A dominates Solution B if:
- `A.accuracy > B.accuracy AND A.latency ≤ B.latency`, OR
- `A.accuracy ≥ B.accuracy AND A.latency < B.latency`

## Algorithm Implementation

### Step 1: Data Preparation
```python
# Convert optimization results to points
points = []
for target_name, result in results.items():
    points.append({
        'target': target_name,
        'accuracy': result.accuracy,
        'latency': result.estimated_latency_ms,
        'model_size': result.model_size_mb,
        'memory': result.memory_usage_mb,
        'strategy': result.optimization_strategy
    })
```

### Step 2: Dominance Check
```python
def is_pareto_optimal(point, all_points):
    for other_point in all_points:
        if point == other_point:
            continue
            
        # Check if other_point dominates point
        dominates = (
            (other_point['accuracy'] > point['accuracy'] and 
             other_point['latency'] <= point['latency']) or
            (other_point['accuracy'] >= point['accuracy'] and 
             other_point['latency'] < point['latency'])
        )
        
        if dominates:
            return False  # point is dominated
    
    return True  # point is Pareto optimal
```

### Step 3: Pareto Frontier Extraction
```python
pareto_frontier = []
for point in points:
    if is_pareto_optimal(point, points):
        pareto_frontier.append(point)
```

## Example Scenario

Consider three optimized models:

| Target | Accuracy | Latency (ms) | Model Size (MB) |
|--------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Cloud Server | 0.95 | 25.5 | 45.2 |
| Edge Device | 0.92 | 45.2 | 8.7 |
| Microcontroller | 0.88 | 120.0 | 0.8 |

### Dominance Analysis:

1. **Cloud vs Edge**: 
   - Cloud has higher accuracy (0.95 > 0.92) AND lower latency (25.5 < 45.2)
   - **Cloud dominates Edge**

2. **Cloud vs Microcontroller**:
   - Cloud has higher accuracy (0.95 > 0.88) AND lower latency (25.5 < 120.0)
   - **Cloud dominates Microcontroller**

3. **Edge vs Microcontroller**:
   - Edge has higher accuracy (0.92 > 0.88) AND lower latency (45.2 < 120.0)
   - **Edge dominates Microcontroller**

### Result:
- **Pareto Frontier**: Only Cloud Server (dominates all others)
- **Dominated Solutions**: Edge Device, Microcontroller

## Visualization

The Pareto frontier can be visualized as:

1. **Scatter Plot**: All solutions plotted with Pareto optimal points highlighted
2. **Frontier Line**: Connected line showing the optimal trade-off curve
3. **Dominance Regions**: Areas showing dominated vs non-dominated solutions

## Practical Applications

### 1. Model Selection
- Choose solutions only from the Pareto frontier
- Avoid dominated solutions (waste of resources)

### 2. Trade-off Analysis
- Understand accuracy-latency trade-offs
- Make informed decisions based on requirements

### 3. Optimization Guidance
- Identify which optimizations are most effective
- Focus efforts on Pareto optimal solutions

### 4. Deployment Strategy
- Select appropriate model based on constraints
- Balance accuracy requirements with latency constraints

## Advanced Considerations

### Multi-Objective Extensions
The same concept applies to multiple objectives:
- Accuracy vs Latency vs Model Size
- Accuracy vs Memory Usage vs Power Consumption

### Weighted Pareto
Sometimes you want to consider weighted combinations:
```python
# Weighted score considering both objectives
weighted_score = w1 * accuracy - w2 * latency
```

### Constraint Handling
Consider deployment constraints:
- Maximum model size
- Maximum latency requirements
- Memory limitations

## Implementation in Deployment Pipeline

The `MultiScaleDeploymentPipeline` class implements:

1. **`_calculate_pareto_frontier()`**: Core Pareto frontier calculation
2. **`visualize_pareto_frontier()`**: Creates visualization plots
3. **`_analyze_scaling_efficiency()`**: Computes efficiency metrics
4. **`_recommend_deployment_strategies()`**: Generates recommendations

### Usage Example:
```python
pipeline = MultiScaleDeploymentPipeline()
results = pipeline.optimize_for_all_targets('baseline_model.keras')
analysis = pipeline.analyze_scaling_trade_offs(results)

pareto_frontier = analysis['pareto_frontier']
# Use pareto_frontier for decision making
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Objective Decision Making**: Eliminates subjective model selection
2. **Resource Optimization**: Avoids inefficient solutions
3. **Clear Trade-offs**: Visualizes accuracy-latency relationships
4. **Deployment Guidance**: Provides actionable recommendations
5. **Scalability Analysis**: Understands performance across targets

The Pareto frontier calculation is essential for making informed decisions about model deployment across different environments with varying constraints and requirements.
